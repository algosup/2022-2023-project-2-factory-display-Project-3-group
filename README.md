## Goal of the project

This project aims at creating a software able to display on a screen data chosen by the user. Screens will be implanted in the client's factories: in Vierzon to begin and probably in France and other countries in the future. In addition to the development of the software, we are in charge of finding the most suitable hardware that will be installed in the plant.

The client of this project is the company [**Jacobi**](https://www.jacobi.net/fr/).
