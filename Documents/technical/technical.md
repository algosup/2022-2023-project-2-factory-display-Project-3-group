# 2. Introduction

## a. Overview

[JACOBI](https://www.jacobi.net/fr/) wants to display informations to their employees in two different rooms on TV's or monitors.

## b. Glossary  or Terminology

| Terms                        | Definition             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wigdet| A widget, active tile, interactive tile, or mini-software is a tool available on an operating system, webpage, or blog. Interactive widgets usually provide information or entertainment.|
| Hardware| In the field of IT, hardware refers to the physical part of devices, telecommunications devices, storage, and peripherals in general. |
| Software| The term software is used to describe software that enables your computer to operate and handles data processing. Several software are installed on your device to give commands, so that specific tasks are performed according to their uses.|
| Database| In the field of IT, |
| MongoDb| In the field of IT,  |
| Authentification| In the field of IT,  |
| Firebase| In the field of IT,  |

| Javascript| In the field of IT,  |
| NodeJs| In the field of IT,  |
| Express| In the field of IT,  |
| Static website| In the field of IT,  |


## c. Context or Background
At the moment, the informations are shared by paper, that is not ecological and wastes a lot of time, furthermore they don't know if all employees are receiving the informations or paying attention to them.
## d. Product and Technical Requirements

Product requirements :
- They want news that are displayed by TVS or monitors. They want that when they connect the tvs or the monitors, the webpage will be display directly.

Technical requirements :
- Following the company's need, **ALGOSUP** was required to buy a mini windows computer and a monitor. The other choice was to use a smart TV, but we think that with this solution there is a problem of security because employees can change the tv's channel.

## e. Future Goals
Jacobi wants to add more screen in their firms, for exemple in Paris or in another countries.

## f. Assumptions
We have to be able to add TVS easily without the help of a technician. 
  
# 3. Solutions
## a. Current or Existing Solution / Design

[Cenareo](https://cenareo.com/?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&utm_term=cenareo&utm_campaign=Branding&hsa_cam=12234004786&hsa_mt=e&hsa_ver=3&hsa_src=g&hsa_ad=538661575911&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_tgt=kwd-778007499720&hsa_acc=5673575680&hsa_grp=128722602387&hsa_kw=cenareo&gclid=CjwKCAiA7IGcBhA8EiwAFfUDsfKyn9b4i27tCc5W9TIZQNZv8Kyrg2cAzSiuPuaGNr_JGzr81WsJ0RoCT1MQAvD_BwE) is a software company that develops digital signage. Digital signage is an interactive communication platform that gives you full control over digital display networks. A easy to use digital signage solution allows you to create, share and manage your stories on any digital display with perfect ease. <br>
Their product is one exemple to our solution. The difference is that we need to create our own solution, designed just for Jacobi.

## b. Suggested or Proposed Solution / Design 

**The hardware:**
We want to use a mini PC Windows with a monitor.

**Launch the website at the start of the computer:**
Use Windows startup.
[Tutorial](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-app-to-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-10-150da165-dcd9-7230-517b-cf3c295d89dd)

**Software:**
We have to make an intranet for **JACOBI**.
How to do it.
To display a website on the browser, we have to use web's technologies like Javascript or Nodejs if we want a compiled language more powerful.<br>
We will use the framework **Express** from NodeJs.<br>
We will use a database to store the campaigns on the cloud to be accessible from all pages of the app.<br>
We choose MongoDb because it is easy to use.<br>
We need a system of authentification to secure the access of the campaign's creation. We will use firebase authentification because it is easy to use and powerfull. MongoDb doesn't provide a specific tool of authentification. We could have used Firebase database but it is not user friendly. We have to host the website on the cloud to be accessible from whatever browser, we choose to use Azure because it is the advice of **ALGOSUP**, we could have choose firebase hosting but it is for static website and ours is dynamic because we use NodeJS.<br>
For the display each screen is related to a subdomain, when we type the subdomain address in the browser, the routage of the software is redirecting the app to a specific html page which is dedicated to display the informations that we want.

**Login page:**
Create a signin and signup with Firebase.

**Persistance of the login:**<br>


**Hosting with Microsoft Azure:**
Connecting the app with DNS and add subdomains to display the campaigns on several screens.

**Managing the data with MongoDB:**
CRUD : Create, Read, Update and Delete the data.
In newCampaign.html, we take the informations of the campaign that the company wants to display.
In campaign.html, we display the list of campaigns that are stored in our database.
In these campaigns, we are storing videos, images and pdfs.

**Programming the campaigns in time:**<br>


**Automatic refresh page:**
`setTimeout(() => {
  document.location.reload();
}, 3000);`


## c. Release / Roll-out and Deployment Plan

**Jacobi** wants to use the product as soon as possible. They want to diffuse their campaigns in strategics's places. They want to display informations in rooms dedicated to employees rest. Indeed, if the use of the product would scale, for exemple to the firm in Paris, they could display another type of campaigns. Also, if the product is to be used in another country, we will change the content to english.  

## d. Alternate Solutions 

We can see this problem from a different perspective and propose a different approach to solve it. One of the point that we can discuss is why use WINDOWS computer instead of phones. <br>
With a phone you can display a subdomain of the campaigns's website easily and with security. The only problem is the lifetime of the battery in our case, because Jacobi wants that the diffusion would be on everytime. 
# 4. Further Considerations
## a. Impact on other teams

 **Jacobi** communication's team will be able to distribute their informations to the employees in a modern way.

 ## b. Regional considerations

**Jacobi** is speaking French in his companies in France.
## c. Cost analysis

We have been ask to respect a budget of 1000â‚¬ per device. So we did our choice considering this restriction.

[hardware_choice.md](https://github.com/algosup/2022-2023-project-2-factory-display-Project-3-group/blob/main/Documents/hardware%20choice/hardware_choice.md)

## d. Security considerations

The main element of safety is the diffusion of the website on the screen. The hardware must be safe. We must avoid any problems related to switch the channel in a recreative goal. For the software part we need to be careful that it is not possible for a hacker to access the webpage without a login.

## e. Privacy considerations

We use a mini-computer to avoid a lot of problems with the use of the screen. If instead of using a mini-computer, we used  smart TV, it would have been much more problems, because you can plug a remote controller to the TV to switch channels, for exemple.



## h. Support considerations

The solution including the hardware and the software has to be user friendly. For exemple, the main user has not skills in computer science, and he will need to use the application easily.
